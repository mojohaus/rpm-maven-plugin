Usage Scenarios

  Listed below are the various scenarios where the RPM plugin can be used
  along with the proper way to configure the project(s) involved.

RPM on Demand

  In this scenario, an RPM is generated from the project on demand by
  executing the goal "<<<rpm:rpm>>>" within a project.  The project itself
  may be configured to produce any sort of packaging, since the RPM is not
  the primary artifact produced by the project.

  If you want the project's artifacts packaged in the RPM, you must generate
  the RPM as a side effect of the standard lifecycle.

  Things which do not work as I envision the 1.0 release working:

  * If this goal is run on a project with modules, it will run the
    "<<<rpm:rpm>>>" goal on each module, rather than packaging the modules into
    a single RPM.

RPM as Side Effect

  In this scenario, an RPM is generated from the project whenever the project
  is packaged.  This must be done whenever the project's primary artifact is
  intended to be part of the RPM package but can be done anytime.  To set up
  this configuration, include the following lines in the plugin definition
  in the project's POM file (see the {{{example1.html}sample configuration}} for
  an example of this):

+-------+
<executions>
  <execution>
    <goals>
      <goal>rpm</goal>
    </goals>
  </execution>
</executions>
+-------+

RPM as Secondary Artifact

  In this scenario, the rpm is not the primary artifact, but will be deployed as
  a secondary artifact.
  
+-------+
<executions>
  <execution>
    <goals>
      <goal>attached-rpm</goal>
    </goals>
  </execution>
</executions>
+-------+

RPM as Primary Artifact

  In this scenario, the RPM is the primary artifact of the project and is
  created by executing the phase "<<<package>>>" within the project.  If
  properly configured, this allows the user to execute "<<<mvn package>>>"
  on a top-level project (which has the items to build and the RPM project
  as modules) and have Maven package the items to build into jars, wars, ears,
  etc. and them assemble the RPM of those items for distribution.
  
  The packaging value should be set to "<<<rpm>>>".

+-------+
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/maven-v4_0_0.xsd ">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    ...
    <packaging>rpm</packaging>
    ...
</project>

  The extensions tag for this plugin should be marked true.

                <version>${project.version}</version>
                <extensions>true</extensions>
                ...
            </plugin>
